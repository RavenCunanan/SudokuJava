    * If `verbose` is true, print out the value that occurs more than once and
    * also print out the `columnNumber` (this printed message can be in any form you like;
    * this is just a suggestion to make debugging easier).
    * Tip: You can add numbers to printed messages like so: `System.out.println("Repeated number: " + 1);`
    *      You can also replace the 1 with a variable like `x`. As long as `x` is not in double quotes,
    *      Java will evaluate x and concatenate your string with the evaluated result of `x`.
    *
    * Hint: you can do this without using anything beyond what we've learned so far in the course.
    * Option 1: use several boolean variables to keep track of which values are in this column
    *           and update them accordingly as you iterate through the cell values
    * Option 2 (harder): use a boolean array to accomplish the same thing
    *
    * Hint: recall that we're using 0 as the default value for cells. In your code,
    *       make sure that two or more 0's in the same column is NOT a conflict.
